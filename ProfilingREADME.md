# Profiling Python Programs with cProfile and Visualization with Snakeviz, Graphviz, and xdot

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- cProfile
- snakeviz
- Graphviz
- xdot

### Installation

#### macOS

```bash
brew install graphviz
brew install xdot
pip install snakeviz
```

#### Windows

For Windows, install snakeviz via pip and download Graphviz and xdot from their official websites.

```bash
pip install snakeviz
```

Add Graphviz's `bin` folder to the system's PATH variable.

## Profiling with cProfile

```bash
# NOTE: You can/should just use the program.prof file already in this repo. But if you want to create a new one, here's how:
python -m cProfile -o program.prof main.py
```

## Visualization

### Using snakeviz

#### macOS & Windows

```bash
snakeviz program.prof
```

### Using Graphviz to create a .dot file

Install `gprof2dot`:

```bash
pip install gprof2dot
```

Run:

```bash
# NOTE: You can/should just use the callingGraph.dot file already in this repo. But if you want to create a new one, here's how:
gprof2dot -f pstats program.prof -o callingGraph.dot
```

### Viewing .dot files

#### Using xdot

##### macOS

```bash
xdot callingGraph.dot
```

##### Windows

Open xdot and use the File menu to load the `.dot` file.

Now you can use xdot along with snakeviz and Graphviz for visualizing your profiling data.
